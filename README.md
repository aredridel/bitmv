Bit Matrices and Vectors
========================

A simple library for doing bit vector and matrix operations.

It's non-uniform, strange, but fast for the `transitiveClosure` function.

Feel free to contribute. Pull requests welcome but benchmarks paid attention to.

If you break backward compatibility, bump the major version.

Thanks go to Jeffrey Kegler for a sample implementation of a transitive closure from [Marpa R2](https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2) using the [Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Warshall_algorithm).
